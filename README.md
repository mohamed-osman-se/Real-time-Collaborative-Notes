# üìù Real-time Collaborative Notes

A small-scale example project showcasing a **Microservices Architecture** with modern backend technologies. This application demonstrates how to design and build distributed systems using **gRPC**, **GraphQL**, **MongoDB**, and **WebSockets** ‚Äî all packaged in a one-click Docker Compose setup.

---

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Real-time Collaboration**: Notes update instantly across multiple clients using GraphQL Subscriptions over WebSockets.
-   **Microservices Architecture**:
    -   **gRPC Service**: Handles core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on notes.
    -   **GraphQL Gateway**: Provides a unified API layer with Queries, Mutations, and Subscriptions.
-   **Strongly-Typed Contracts**: Service definitions are defined using **Protocol Buffers (protobuf)** for efficient and type-safe communication.
-   **Flexible Data Storage**: Uses **MongoDB** (NoSQL) for schema-less data persistence.
-   **Containerized Deployment**: Run the entire system with a single command: `docker-compose up --build`.
